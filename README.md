The Iris flower data set, commonly known as Fischer’s Iris data set, is a collection of 150 samples of Iris flowers including measures of their petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width in centimeters. The flowers are further classified by their species type Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor. There are 50 samples of each species within the dataset.

The data set itself was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems[1]. The data was originally collected by the American Botanist Edgar Anderson and is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set.
