# 1. Introduction
The Iris flower data set, commonly known as Fischer’s Iris data set, is a collection of 150 samples of Iris flowers including measurements of the flower's **petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width** in centimeters. The flowers are further classified by their species type **Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor**. There are 50 samples of each species within the dataset.

The data set itself was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*[1]. The data was originally collected by the American Botanist Edgar Anderson and is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set.

Fisher in his paper used the dataset to perform a discriminant analysis in an attempt to find *“What linear function of the four measurements will maximize the ratio of the difference between the specific means to the standard deviations within species”*[1]. 
Linear discriminate analysis or Fishers discriminant method is used across scientific fields to separate 2 or more classes of objects based on a combination of features.[2] In this case the 3 Species are separated based on the measurements for petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width.

The dataset is widely used today as a training data for statistical analysis. The data provides a suitable beginners problem in machine learning[3]. While Iris Setosa can be easily distinguished from the other two species separating Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica the later two species are more difficult to separate as there is more overlap between values.
